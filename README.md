# README.md
Hello! :wave:

And welcome to a README of... me!

This is a document all about me - who I am, how I work, what I enjoy etc, etc.

# Who am I?

My name is Oliver Nural, my hobbies include playing music and games, (and _creating_ music and games), and I like creating cool stuff. My website is probably broken right now, but google my name in the future and it'll maybe be fixed by then!

I am predominantly a developer at AND Digital, joining after graduating University in October 2016, and have worked on some really cool projects including a regtech startup and an enterprise hospitality company. 

My favourite stack is Javascript, and I'm a big fan of Node.js and React, but after accidentally becoming a DevOps engineer, my colleagues now think I know a thing or about DevOps. In reality I just say Amazon Cloud Services a lot and talk about how great Kubernetes is all the time. 

Currently I am creating On Demand Environments using my favourite tool, Kubernetes, for multiple developments teams - allowing testing gates to be implemented and helping to reinforce the DevOps culture throughout the development lifecycle. 

It’s a good idea to start with a brief explanation of what the document is. Also don’tforget to include a few basics about who you are, what your skills/areas ofexpertise are, and what your job is (this is particularly relevant if you’re in a slightlyunusual role, or one that people might not have experience of)

# How I Work

The thing I enjoy most at work is working with, and teaching, other people. I am a huge fan of pair programming, and believe that 2 heads are most _definitely_ better than 1.

I am an early bird... when I wake up early. Sounds odd, but that's just how it is. 

At work, I often get a lot of work done in the *morning*, slow down during lunchtime, and then peak back up in the *late afternoon / evening*

When i'm working on my own, I often work with my headphones listening to either Indie, Jazz or Piano music - but this does not mean I'm busy! Please feel free to poke me/nudge me/wave at me to get my attention as it's just to drown out noise most of the time.

# Working atmosphere and process

I like working environments that have a relaxed atmosphere, yet where people still work hard and are motivated to get quality work delivered. I enjoy my work more when I know it matters, and am much more motivated to work when I enjoy it. 

If I enjoy my work, then don't be suprised to see commits coming during the weekend or late in the evening - I fully embrace the hipster stereotype of working in Coffee shops and out and about in London.

I am most happy creating something that I am truly proud of, and helping others learn and develop to create something they are truly proud of too.
